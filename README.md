# Predictive modeling in banking industry
Bank Case Study
This folder contains multiple predictive modeling and implementation case studies for banking industry. 
For real world application may require further parameter tunes and case by case analysis.

# Case Prospect Refine _ Python
### Objective
Refine Campaign population and target those high potential customers
Classification: Identify customers with high propensity to response or sign the product
Cluster: Segment customers and customize marketing strategy

# Case Behavior Anaylsis _ Python-SQL
### Objective
For retails who provide both online and in-store services, customers can visit store/online for 'window shopping', if interested then quote for price or try things on, if satisfied then purchase. Thus visit, quote and purchase activities are weighted accordingly. Also, understand customer's channel preference and activities could be important for future marketing strategies and budget allocation. This analysis developed scores for measuring customer’s channel usages, digital engagement and activity level, created badges for segmenting customers by behavior patterns.

# Case Look-alike and One-class Classificaiont _ Python
### Objective
Identify look-alikes and check similarity
Look-alike modeling is a process that identifies people who has similar feature or just look/act like the target audiences. It's commonly used in marketing to identify prospect who has similar behavior pattern as targeting clients.
Key takeaways:
Always understand the goal, best customers may have different definition based on the needs and business model. For example, in this case the best customers could be either the one who purchased multiple products and has deeper engagement with the entity, or simply signed contract with the business and paid the fixed service fee.
Understand the “best customer” segment and define commonalities. These traits may include anything from household income, balance with the firm, engagement to the business, or activity on different channel / platforms.
Once we know how "best customer" look like, we can dentify all customers within the expansive database who share the same characteristics as the best customers, and try to develop relationship with them and turn them to real "best customers".
Look-alike could be converted to traditional binary classification if the not-alike is obtainable, or anormly detection (one class classification) when the rest not look-alike minority shows significant different as look-alike.
